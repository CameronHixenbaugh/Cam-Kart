# Cam-Kart

This repository contains the scripts used to build a simple kart game in Unity Game Engine. The purpose of creating this karting game is to demonstrate my ability to use C# and Unity. All of the graphics are free assets from the Unity Asset Store. 

## Current Status
Currently the game is single player and there is only one vehicle which is controlled by the user by using the directional arrows. A simple track has been created to demonstrate how the game will work, but over development more difficult tracks will be created. There are three power ups in the game so far which may be adjusted in the future along with some newly created ones. Some more features that will be added are:
- NPC Racers
- Timer
- Lap Counter
- Racer placses
- Mini Map
- More power ups
- Customizable cars
- Race Rewards

## Track
Thus far only one track has been created to demonstrate how the game will work. All of the graphics are Unity's free assets that have been downloaded from Unity's Asset Store.

The player controls their car by using the directional arrows and tries to follow the track. The camera will automatically follow the vehicle and stay behind it. 

## Power Ups

Currently there are only three power ups, but they will be refined and more will be created over time. 

### **Speed Power Up**

The speed power up is indicated by the yellow boxes on the track. When the player hits the box with their car the vehicle will turn yellow and the speed will double. The power up will only last 5 seconds before the vehicle is returned to it's original color and speed.

### **Size Power Up**

The size power up is indicated by the brown boxes on the track. When the player hits the box with their car the vehicle will grow 3 times it's original size for 5 seconds before returning to it's original size. 

### **Laser Power Up**

The laser power up is indicated by the purple boxes on the track. When the player hits the box with their car they will have the ability to shoot lasers by pressing the space bar. This power up lasts for 5 seconds.(When other racers are introduced to the game, if they are struck by a laser they will by forzen for 3 seconds before being allowed to move again)
