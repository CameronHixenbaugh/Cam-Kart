# Cam-Kart

This repository contains the scripts used to build a simple kart game in Unity game engine. The purpose of creating this karting game is to demonstrate my ability to use C# and Unity. All of the graphics are free assets from the Unity Asset store. 

## Current Status
Currently the game has one kart that has the ability to drive around based on the user's input of th edirectional arrows. Some power ups when the kart hits a box that increases the kart's speed for 5 seconds, increases the kart's size for 5 seconds, and gives the ability for the kart to shoot lasers for 5 seconds. Pictures and videos are coming as soon as a track can be fully developed.
